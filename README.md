# Sweetgrass-Kitchen
A semester long capstone project where 4 programmers, 1 IT professional, and a graphic designer created a comprehensive system for a proposed restaurant LLC. I worked primarily on the front-end of the proposed restaurant's website, where I created pages that were visually striking and performed well in conjunction with the back-end (mostly using php and html/css). This included multiple information pages, a customer-accessible order system, and social media links. The project followed a typical agile system development lifecycle with consistent progress. This project also came with a plethora of documentation that me and my team wrote detailing the system in its entirety.
